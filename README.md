- Isolation from development database
- No additional database setup required
- Consistent test environment across different machines

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
php artisan test
```

Run specific test suite:
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/API/AttributeControllerTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/API/ProjectControllerTest.php
